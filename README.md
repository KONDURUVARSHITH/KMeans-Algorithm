# KMeans-Algorithm

Tasks to Code
Load the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.
Visualize the dataset using scatter plots to see if there are any natural clusters in the data.
Preprocess the data by scaling it to ensure that all the features are on the same scale.
Use the KMeans algorithm to cluster the data into three clusters, one for each type of flower.
Visualize the clusters using scatter plots and color-coding to see how well the algorithm was able to separate the different types of flowers.
Evaluate the quality of the clustering using metrics such as the silhouette score.
Experiment with different values of K (the number of clusters) to see how it affects the quality of the clustering.
Implement hierarchical clustering and compare the results with KMeans.
